# Sensor_Home-Automation_Autonomous-Control

A sensor-based home automation system utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) technology without requiring direct human control. The system aims to enhance the comfort, convenience, and energy efficiency of residential spaces by intelligently managing various home devices and appliances. Sensors placed strategically throughout the home environment continuously monitor different parameters such as motion, temperature, light, and humidity. Sensors Based Home Automation can be used to operate your home appliances like lights, fans, and air conditioners by sensing motion, temperature, and environmental conditions at that place. So, if you forget to switch off the lights or other appliances while going out, it helps you to turn off the appliances automatically by sensing. It works on automatic control of home appliances. The integration of PIR sensors, IR sensors, and motion sensors into IoT home automation systems allows for the detection of human presence, motion, and temperature changes. PIR sensors are passive sensors that detect infrared radiation emitted by warm bodies, such as humans and animals. IR sensors, on the other hand, can be used for object detection and temperature monitoring. Motion sensors, often combined with PIR or IR technology, detect physical movement within their range. The Arduino Uno acts as the central control unit and is responsible for receiving Arduino Uno signals to the sensor and guides for appropriate actions based on the Transmitted information.

The sensors act as switches, controlling the power supply to respective appliances. Depending on the design and requirements of the system, the PIR sensor, LDR sensor, and Temperature sensor can be used to control various home automation components continuously. The sensor senses a person entering the room and based on the presence of the human being light, fan, or AC machine will be turned on/off. AC machine is controlled based on the room temperature; Arduino controls the devices with sensor inputs.
